    <p>Water and air. So very commonplace are these
        substances, they hardly attract attention - and
        yet they vouchsafe our very existence.</p>
    <p id="pullquote">Every time I view the sea I feel
        a calming sense of security, as if visiting my
        ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing.
    </p>
    <p>Mystery of mysteries, water and air are right
        there before us in the sea.</p>
